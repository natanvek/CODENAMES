# Custom Codenames

## Date

The project was completed in July 2020.

## Description

In the the early days of the pandemic, I programmed this custom Codenames, also known in spanish as "c√≥digo secreto" from scratch to play with my friends over Zoom calls. It was hosted on a free server (Heroku) to enable online play and had many features that other Codenames websites, such as https://www.horsepaste.com/ did not offer. Currently, the server where it was hosted is no longer maintained.

In this project I gave my first steps with servers and required a lot of CSS coding.
